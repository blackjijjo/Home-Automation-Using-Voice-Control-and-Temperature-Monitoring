# Home_Automation_Using_Voice_Control_and_Temperatute_Monitoring
An IOT Project Using Arduino

This is a Advanced IOT project where anyone using google voice assistant can control their Home Electrical Appliances from anywhere in the World. Also they can check their home temperature using a monitoring System.

When people think about home automation system, most of them get to a thought of living in a smart
home: One remote controller for every household appliance, cooking the rice automatically, starting air
conditioner automatically, heating water for bath automatically and shading the window automatically
during the night. To some extent, home automation equals to the smart home. Then automatically
these will bring out smart living condition and make our life more convenient and fast. Early home
automation began with laborsaving machines. As per recent surveys, there exists system neither at
cheaper rates nor easy to handle. Current systems are generally proprietary, closed and not very userfriendly
based on Arduino or NodeMCU or low-cost home security system and home automation. In the
year 2006, S. M. AnamulHaque, S. M. Kamruzzaman, and Md. Ashraful Islam designed a system “A
System for Smart-Home Control of Appliances Based on Time and Speech Interaction” that controls the
home appliances using the computer. The system is developed by using the Visual Basic 6.0 as
programming language and Microsoft voice engine tools for the purpose of speech recognition.
Appliances can be controlled either by the timer or by voice commands. On the basis of SMS takes a
decision of a particular task.

The designing of the system is divided into two main categories 1. The Hardware - Hardware mainly
deals with Control Unit which comprises of microcontroller NodeMCU, Relays, Driver IC (used for
devices like motors). 2. The Software - The Arduino IDE Software, the Blynk app, the IFTTT app, and the
Google Assistant constitute the software of the design and these applications would be integrated in
the Android device. The Blynk app on an Android device communicates with the microcontroller and
sends the desired signal via the internet.
